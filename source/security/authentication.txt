These guides show you how to authenticate to a MongoDB instance using the
Node.js driver.

The :doc:`Authentication Mechanisms </security/authentication/mechanisms>` guide contains

MongoDB Community Edition which includes:

- ``DEFAULT``
- ``SCRAM-SHA-256``
- ``SCRAM-SHA-1``
- ``MONGODB-CR``
- ``MONGODB-AWS``
- ``X.509``

The :doc:`Enterprise Authentication Mechanisms
</security/authentication/enterprise-mechanisms>` guide contains sample
connection code using authentication mechanisms available only in MongoDB
Enterprise Edition which includes:

- ``Kerberos (GSSAPI/SSPI)``
- ``LDAP (PLAIN)``
- ``MONGODB-OIDC``

.. note::
   For instructions on MongoDB driver installation and deployment setup, see
