Overview
--------

MongoDB drivers have historically differed in how they encode
**universally unique identifiers** (UUIDs). In this guide, you can learn how to use
{+driver-short+}'s ``UuidRepresentation`` configuration option to maintain cross-language
compatibility when working with UUIDs.

.. tip::

   In MongoDB applications, you can use the ``ObjectId`` type as a unique identifier for
   a document. Consider using ``ObjectId`` in place of a UUID where possible.
